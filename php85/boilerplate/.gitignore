# Be sure to place all directories here, which are downloaded through composer, contain temporary data, uploaded user data, or any other stuff which does not belong to the source code itself.
# In other words the repo should be completely stateless.
# Exceptions are lock-files like composer.lock or yarn.lock, which provide a state but are essentially for deployment
